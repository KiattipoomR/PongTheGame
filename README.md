# Pong ! - The Game

My very first Unity game project.
The game is in the "Builds" folder.

## How to play

The game features two players (as paddles) and a ball. Player will get points when the opponent misses a ball. The goal is to reach the score limit. (Currently no option to play against computer.)

## Controls

- Player One : Use W,S key to move.
- Player Two : Use ↑,↓ key to move.

## To-do

- Add main menu, pause menu, and "game over" menu.
- Add features to change the score limit.
- Add sounds.

## Version History

1.0 - The simplest version of the game. No any menus. Score limit at one (but with no scoreboard). The game will freeze when either player wins.
